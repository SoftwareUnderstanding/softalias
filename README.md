# Description.
This project contains both a web demo and a series of Python scripts designed to manipulate and transform data extracted from this [dataset](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6wwpzgn2c).

The purpose of the project is to process the collected data, which is initially provided in various formats (pkl and csv), and perform a series of data cleaning and transformation tasks.

# Project Structure
The project consists of two main folders:

- Folder web_demo_kg: Contains the web demo. To install and run the demo, please refer to the README file located in this folder.

- Script folder: This is where all the Python scripts used to process the data are stored. These scripts are responsible for reading, cleaning, transforming and verifying the data.

The input data used for this project are the .pkl files from the 'disambiguated' folder, the .csv files from 'linked' and the .pkl files from 'intermediate_files' present in the [dataset](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6wwpzgn2c).
